\section{Conclusion}

After testing the Monte Carlo method to calcualte the value of $\pi$, the dynamic process management (DPM) method of programming calculated the value of $\pi$ the fastest with the least amount of deviation from the known value of $\pi$. Although DPM was superior to the other methods, it requires more lines of code and a higher-level of programming ability. 

Throughout the course of the semester, the authors have gained knowledge in parallel computing applications such as Python's \texttt{mpi4py} library and various mathematical methods utilized to improve throughput and efficiency in programming. In addition, the authors have gained experience in setting up cluster computing environments using GNU/Linux software and configuring networks in order to optimize interconnections between cluster computing nodes.
